            <h2><u> Method: </u></h2>
 
            <ol>
 
                <li> Marinate the chicken in soy sauce and garlic,The garlic needs to be crushed for best results. This process takes 1 hour to 12 hours depending on how flavorful you want the dish to be.</li>
 
                <li> Separate the chicken from the marinade make sure to set the marinade aside because it will be used later on. </li>
 
                <li> Pan-fry the chicken. Fry for 1 to 1 Â½ minutes per side. This will partially cook the outer part. It also makes the skin tough enough to withstand stewing later. This means that it will remain intact, which is nice for presentation.</li>
 
                <li> Pour marinade into the pot and add water.Let boil, The bay leaves and whole peppercorn can now be added. </li>
 
                <li> Simmer for 20 to 25 minutes.It can take a it longer depending on the quality of the chicken. However, feel free to cook longer in low heat for a super tender chicken adobo.</li>
 
                <li> Season and serve. Add sugar and salt. I only add salt if needed. It is important to taste your dish before adding seasonings. Filipino chicken adobo can be served with or without sauce.</li>
